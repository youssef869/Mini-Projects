# Introduction
Buttons are commonly employed as input devices in digital systems. When pressed or released, they generate electrical signals that are recognized as binary logic levels (0 and 1). However, the mechanical nature of these switches can introduce noise or result in a phenomenon known as "bouncing.".
A debouncing circuit aims to minimize or eliminate the effects of button bouncing. Its purpose is to ensure that each button press or release results in a single, clean, and stable logic output.There are two types of that circuit which are delay detection and early detection.
